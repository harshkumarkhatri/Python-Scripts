# Text to mail list
This is a python script which i created.
<br>**About the script**
<br>This script can be used to scrape out all the necessary emails from a large amount of text which only has emails, some extra characters and some spaces.
<br>
I found this large list of emails from a website and thought of using this for e-mail campaign purpose and made a script to extract out essential data which is the mails from the text and then store that data to a csv file.
